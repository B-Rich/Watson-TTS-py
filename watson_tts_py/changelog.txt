watson_tts_py v0.1
* returns the name of the file after writing to it. Really useful.

watson_tts_py v0.2
* added auth()
* you can either use it to enter your username or password, or pass it when calling parse()
* example:
auth("username", "password")
file = parse("cool text huh", audio_type="ogg", voice="en-US_LisaVoice")
get_file(file)
* added binary.
it's not _literally_ binary, but it returns the content of the file without writing to it.
pass it when calling get_file()
get_file(file, binary=True)
